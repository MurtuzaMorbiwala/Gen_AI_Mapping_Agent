# Gen AI Mapping Agent
Automation to Help Build A Source to Target Mapping Using Data Profiling provided in an excel file. 

Sometimes the companies that we work for do not want to share database access to AI Agents but schema details maybe ok to share. 

This project looks at how well an agent is able to create code to map source tables to a target datawarehouse table for common repititive tasks. 

Conclusion
        Claude Model Performed better than Gemini on this task by far even gave the result with zero shot learning. 
        
        We do not need to provide the actual data for the code to be generated. 
        
        Zero shot prompts did not work very well in this task.
        
        Few Shot prompting gave good results with claude and gemini both.
