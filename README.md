# Gen AI Mapping Agent
Automation to Help Build A Source to Target Mapping Using Data Profiling provided in an excel file. 

Sometimes the companies that we work for do not want to share database access to AI Agents but schema details maybe ok to share. 

This project looks at how well an agent is able to create code to map source tables to a target datawarehouse table for common repititive tasks. 

The output of the agent can be enhanced by providing more direction into the prompts.

It only took 2 suggestions to generate the query using a single prompt. With the example provided the query was generated instantly.
